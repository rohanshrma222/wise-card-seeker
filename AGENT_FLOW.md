# AI Agent Flow & Prompt Design

This document describes the conversational flow and prompt design for the AI credit card advisor agent used in this project (see `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`).

---

## Conversation Flow

The agent follows a structured, step-by-step conversation to collect user information for credit card recommendations:

1. **Ask about monthly income (in rupees)**
2. **Ask about spending habits**
   - (fuel, travel, groceries, dining, shopping)
3. **Ask about preferred benefits**
4. **Ask about credit score range**
5. **Analysis**
   - After collecting all information, the agent responds: _"Perfect! I'm analyzing your profile..."_

**Guidelines:**

- The agent is conversational and helpful
- Asks one question at a time
- Keeps responses concise (2-3 sentences max)
- Uses Indian context (rupees, Indian banks)

## System Prompt

The system prompt provided to the AI is as follows:

```
